# Failed
these are basically failed scripts in which well it doesn't work, but i'd still want the around just incase there was something interesting i might use later

> [!NOTE]
> plus in a way, this is to keep track my failed script d:, who knows maybe would be 100s of failed script before i found a gem ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
> or even better... there is a hidden gem hidden in these failed scripts
